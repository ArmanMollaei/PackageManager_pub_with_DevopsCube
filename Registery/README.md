Docker Registry is an application that manages storing and delivering Docker container images. Registries centralize container images and reduce build times for developers. 
Docker images guarantee the same runtime environment through virtualization, but building an image can involve a significant time investment. For example, 
rather than installing dependencies and packages separately to use Docker, developers can download a compressed image from a registry that contains all of the necessary components.
Furthermore, developers can automate pushing images to a registry using continuous integration tools, 
uch as TravisCI, to seamlessly update images during production and development.
